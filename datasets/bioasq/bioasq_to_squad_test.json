Common symptoms include neuropathic pain and autonomic disturbances, and the typical clinical presentation is that of a length-dependent polyneuropathy, although other distributions could be present.\nSmall fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a peripheral nervous system disease due to affection of A-delta or C-fibers in a proximal, distal, or diffuse distribution.

Although multiple causes of small nerve fibre degeneration have been reported, including via genetic mutations, the cause of small fibre neuropathy remains unknown in up to 50% of cases.

This article summarizes the milestones in the development of lenacapavir leading to this first approval for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.\nLenacapavir: a first-in-class HIV-1 capsid inhibitor.\nPURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes available data for lenacapavir, an investigational first-in-class agent that disrupts functioning of HIV capsid protein across multiple steps in the viral life cycle.RECENT FINDINGS: Lenacapavir demonstrated picomolar potency in vitro with no cross resistance to existing antiretroviral classes and potent antiviral activity in persons with HIV-1. In persons with HIV-1, there was no preexisting resistance to lenacapavir regardless of treatment history.\nIn heavily treatment-experienced persons with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 and in treatment-naive persons with HIV-1, lenacapavir in combination with other antiretroviral agents led to high rates of virologic suppression and was well tolerated.SUMMARY: Ongoing studies are evaluating long-acting dosing of lenacapavir for treating HIV-1 in combination with other antiretrovirals and preventing HIV-1 as a single agent.\n",
