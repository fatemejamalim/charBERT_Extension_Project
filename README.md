## charBERT Extension Project

### Overview
This project extends the CharBERT model for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, focusing on character-level representations in BERT models. It includes experiments on baseline models, domain adaptation, and multilingual support.

### Features
- Baseline Models: Implementation and evaluation of standard baseline models.
- Domain Adaptation: Techniques for adapting models to specific domains.
- Multilingual Support: Extending CharBERT for multilingual NLP tasks.

### Getting Started
1. Install Dependencies: Use requirements.txt to install necessary packages.
2. Run Experiments: Jupyter notebooks provided for running different experiments (experiment_baseline_models.ipynb, experiment_domain_adaptation.ipynb, etc.)

### Repository Structure
- CharBERT/: Core CharBERT implementation.
- datasets/: Datasets used in experiments.
- Various Jupyter notebooks for experiments.
